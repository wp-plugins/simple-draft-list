Simple Draft List will display a list of the titles of your posts/pages that have not yet been published

== Description ==

This is a very useful way to display the titles of your draft or scheduled posts and pages - maybe as a "coming soon" teaser for example.

**Using a PHP Function**

You would use this option is you wished to display the list outside of a page or post - e.g. in a sidebar. To display the list you will need to insert the following code, where appropriate, into your theme…

`<?php simple_draft_list('parameters'); ?>`

Where `parameters` is an optional list of parameters, each seperated by an ampersand (&)

These are as follows...

*limit=* : The maximum number of draft items to display. The default is 0, which is unlimited. A limit of just 1 will cause the `<li>` tags not to be used, allowing you to embed the result in a sentence.

*type=* : This allows you to limit the results to either `post` or `page`. The default is both.

*order=* : This is the sequence that you'd like to order the results in. It consists of 2 codes - the first is either `t` or `d` to represent the title or date and the second is `a` or `d` for ascending or descending. Therefore `order=td` will display the results in descending title sequence. The default is descending date.

*scheduled=* : If specified as `No` then scheduled posts will not display in the list, only drafts.

*icon=* : If scheduled posts are listed, then an icon will appear next to them to indicate this is the case. Use this to switch the icon off or define its position - `No`, `Left` or `Right` (`Left` is the default).

*folder=* : The scheduled icon will be, by default, the one in the plugin folder named `scheduled.png`. However, use this parameter to specify a folder within your theme that you'd prefer the icon to be fetched from.

*author=* : Allows you to specify whether you want the authors name to appear next to the draft post/page item. Should be `No` or `Yes` (defaults to the former).

The plugin will then display the list as an HTML list (i.e. with `<li>` and `</li>` around each entry).

An example would be...

`<?php simple_draft_list('limit=5&type=posts&order=da&scheduled=no'); ?>`

This would display a list of up to 5 draft posts in ascending date sequence.

The following is an example of how it could be used in the sidebar, with a `function_exists` check so that it doesn't cause problems if the plugin is not active...

`<?php if (function_exists('simple_draft_list')) : ?>
<h2>Coming Soon</h2>
<ul><?php simple_draft_list('limit=5&type=posts&order=da&scheduled=no'); ?></ul>
<?php endif; ?>`

If you wish to omit a page or post from the list then you can do this by simply giving the post/page a title beginning with an exlamation mark. You can then remove this before publishing the page/post.

**Using a Shortcode**

Use this option to display the list within a post or page. Unlike the PHP Function option, the `<ul>` and `</ul>` tags will be added automatically.

An example would be...

`[drafts limit=5 type=posts order=da scheduled=no]`

Parameter are listed with a space seperating then, rather than the ampersand used before. Regardless, all the parameter used by the PHP Function are available with the shortcode.

Simple Draft List will display a list of the titles of your posts/pages that have not yet been published

== Description ==

This is a very useful way to display the titles of your draft or scheduled posts and pages - maybe as a "coming soon" teaser for example.

To display the list on your site you will need to insert the following code, where appropriate, into your theme…

`<?php simple_draft_list('parameters'); ?>`

Where `parameters` is an optional list of parameters, each seperated by an ampersand (&)

These are as follows...

*limit=* : The maximum number of draft items to display. The default is 0, which is unlimited. A limit of just 1 will cause the `<li>` tags not to be used, allowing you to embed the result in a sentence.

*type=* : This allows you to limit the results to either `posts` or `pages`. The default is both.

*order=* : This is the sequence that you'd like to order the results in. It consists of 2 codes - the first is either `t` or `d` to represent the title or date and the second is `a` or `d` for ascending or descending. Therefore `order=td` will display the results in descending title sequence. The default is descending date.

*scheduled=* : If specified as `No` then scheduled posts will not display in the list, only drafts.

The plugin will then display the list as an HTML list (i.e. with `<li>` and `</li>` around each entry).

An example would be...

`<?php simple_draft_list('limit=5&type=posts&order=da&scheduled=no'); ?>`

This would display a list of up to 5 draft posts in ascending date sequence.

The following is an example of how it could be used in the sidebar, with a `function_exists` check so that it doesn't cause problems if the plugin is not active...

`<?php if (function_exists('simple_draft_list')) : ?>`
`<h2>Coming Soon</h2>`
`<ul><?php simple_draft_list('limit=5&type=posts&order=da&scheduled=no'); ?></ul>`
`<?php endif; ?>`

If you wish to omit a page or post from the list then you can do this by simply giving the post/page a title beginning with an exlamation mark. You can then remove this before publishing the page/post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `simple-draft-list` folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. There is no options screen - configuration is done in your code.
